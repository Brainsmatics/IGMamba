# IGMamba-Net: Inverse External with Gated Attention Driven Mamba-CNN for Biomedical Image Segmentation
# Introduction
IGMamba is a general multi-network model based on the Mamba-CNN for biomedical image segmentation.We introduced inverse external attention and gated attention, and based on them designed a local feature extraction module and a feature fusion extraction module, and introduced a global feature extraction module to enhance the segmentation performance..This repository contains the code used in the study.
