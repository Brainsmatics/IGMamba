# IGMamba-Net: Inverse External with Gated Attention Driven Mamba-CNN for Biomedical Image Segmentation
# Introduction
IGMamba is a general multi-network model based on the Mamba-CNN for biomedical image segmentation. We designed a local feature extraction module and a feature fusion extraction module, and introduced a global feature extraction module. This repository contains the code and datasets used in the study.
